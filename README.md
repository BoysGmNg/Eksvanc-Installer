# Eksvanc-Installer
Hi, when we released Eksvanc 15.05.54, people were upset because it used the .apks format, which was way harder to install than a traditional .apk file. Even though we wrote clear instructions on how to install the new Vanced build, people still couldn't figure it out. Then we thought, "why don't we make a manager for eksvanc, which will download, update and uninstall Eksvanc and MicroG, have an easy and understandable UI and be less than 10mb?" and that's how Eksvanc Manager was born.  After 3 months of development, we are finally ready to introduce Eksvanc Manager to the masses. Eksvanc manager can easily install and uninstall eksvanc and microg, has various settings for customisation and better experience. The Manager comes with an easy-to-use interface
